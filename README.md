this is a mini forum without main subject, you can just discuss everything just create an account


This project uses Harmonia. Harmonia is a framework meant to serve as a foundation for every project following the React-Express-MySQL stack, as learned in Wild Code School.
It's pre-configured with a set of tools which'll help students produce industry-quality and easier-to-maintain code, while staying a pedagogical tool.
i also used tailwindcss and daisyui a library component 

## Setup & Use

**Windows users:** be sure to run these commands in a git terminal to avoid [issues with newline formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline#Issues_with_different_newline_formats):

```
git config --global core.eol lf
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

- In VSCode, install plugins **Prettier - Code formatter** and **ESLint** and configure them
- Clone this repo, enter it
- Run command `npm install`
- Create environment files (`.env`) in both `server` and `client`: you can copy `.env.sample` files as starters (**don't** delete them)
- Run a db:migrate and don't forget to launch ur Mysql in windows services

### Available Commands

- `db:migrate` : Run the database migration script
- `db:seed` : Run the database seed script
- `dev` : Starts both servers (client + server) in one terminal
- `dev:client` : Starts the React client
- `dev:back` : Starts the Express server
- `lint` : Runs validation tools (will be executed on every _commit_, and refuse unclean code)

## Wireframe

i didn't make any wireframe instead i get my inspiration for the design by looking at this community template https://preview.cruip.com/community/index.html
